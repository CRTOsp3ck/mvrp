In an ERP system, shipping terms and shipping methods are crucial for managing logistics and supply chain processes. Here are some common options:

### **Shipping Terms**
Shipping terms define the responsibilities of the seller and buyer for transportation costs, risk management, and delivery of goods. The most widely used shipping terms are from the **Incoterms** (International Commercial Terms), set by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). Some key Incoterms include:

1. **FOB (Free on Board)**
   - Seller's responsibility ends when goods are loaded onto the shipping vessel. Buyer covers transportation from that point onward.

2. **CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight)**
   - Seller covers cost, insurance, and freight to deliver goods to the destination port. Risk transfers to the buyer once the goods are on the ship.

3. **EXW (Ex Works)**
   - Seller makes goods available at their premises. Buyer bears all costs and risks involved in the transportation from there.

4. **DDP (Delivered Duty Paid)**
   - Seller is responsible for all transportation, taxes, and duties until the goods arrive at the buyer's location.

5. **DAP (Delivered at Place)**
   - Seller is responsible for delivery to the buyer's specified location, excluding import duties and taxes, which the buyer pays.

6. **FCA (Free Carrier)**
   - Seller delivers goods to a carrier or a nominated place. Risk passes when the goods are handed over to the carrier.

7. **CPT (Carriage Paid To)**
   - Seller pays for transport to the named destination, but risk transfers to the buyer once the goods are handed over to the first carrier.

### **Shipping Methods**
Shipping methods refer to the modes of transportation for delivering goods from one location to another. Here are common shipping methods:

1. **Air Freight**
   - Suitable for high-value, time-sensitive goods. It’s faster but more expensive than other methods.
   
2. **Sea Freight**
   - Common for large shipments, especially international trade. It is cost-effective for bulky goods but has longer transit times.

3. **Ground Shipping**
   - Includes delivery by trucks or rail, suitable for domestic or short-distance deliveries. It can be part of multimodal shipping for international trade.

4. **Courier Service**
   - For small or urgent packages. Courier services like DHL, FedEx, and UPS offer door-to-door, fast, and reliable delivery.

5. **Rail Freight**
   - Used for heavy or bulk shipments over land, offering an economical option for long distances inland.

6. **Multimodal/Intermodal**
   - Combining two or more transportation methods (e.g., sea + road or air + rail) to optimize cost and efficiency.

7. **Drop Shipping**
   - The seller doesn’t keep goods in stock but transfers customer orders to a third-party supplier who ships directly to the customer.

8. **Third-Party Logistics (3PL)**
   - Outsourcing shipping and warehousing to specialized logistics providers who handle transportation and fulfillment.

### **Other Considerations**
- **Expedited Shipping**: Offers faster delivery times at a premium cost.
- **Standard Shipping**: Regular, cost-effective shipping with moderate delivery times.
- **Same-day/Next-day Shipping**: Premium service for urgent deliveries.
- **Economy Shipping**: Cheapest but slowest shipping method, often used for non-urgent deliveries.

In an ERP system, these terms and methods should be configurable based on the needs of the business, customers, and suppliers.
