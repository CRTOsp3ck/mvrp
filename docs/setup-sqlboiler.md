Here are the steps to verify the installation and run [`sqlboiler`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22sqlboiler%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A18%2C%22character%22%3A37%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition"):

1. **Verify Installation**:
   Ensure that [`sqlboiler`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22sqlboiler%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A18%2C%22character%22%3A37%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") is installed. You can check this by running:
   ```sh
   sqlboiler --version
   ```
   If it is installed correctly, this command should display the version of [`sqlboiler`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22sqlboiler%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A18%2C%22character%22%3A37%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").

2. **Install [`sqlboiler`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22sqlboiler%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A18%2C%22character%22%3A37%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")** (if not already installed):
   If [`sqlboiler`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22sqlboiler%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A18%2C%22character%22%3A37%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") is not installed, you can install it using `go get`:
   ```sh
   go install github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler/v4@latest
   ```

3. **Ensure `GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH**:
   Make sure that the directory where Go binaries are installed is in your PATH. You can add it to your PATH by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:
   ```sh
   export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
   ```
   Then, reload your shell configuration:
   ```sh
   source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```

4. **Run [`sqlboiler`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22sqlboiler%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fsp3ck%2Fdev%2Fmvrp%2Fcmd%2Fgen%2Fmodel%2Fgen.go%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A18%2C%22character%22%3A37%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")**:
